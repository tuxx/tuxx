## 💻 About Me  
I write code for a living 💰 and for fun 🎉 (which means I spend too much time behind a computer screen).  
If it runs on Linux, I’ve probably broken it at least once before making it better.

📰 **Blog:** [https://tuxx.net](https://tuxx.net) — where I dump some of the random things I do or find interesting.

## 🧠 I Maintain These Cool (and Questionably Useful) Projects

### 📱 [LinxShare](https://github.com/tuxx/LinxShare)  
> Android app for uploading files to your self-hosted [linx-server](https://github.com/andreimarcu/linx).  
> Perfect for sharing cat pics 🐱 or random shell scripts 💀 in style.

### 🖼️ [localpics](https://github.com/tuxx/localpics)  
> A Go program that displays your local folders in a webpage without any processing.  
> Like a gallery, but it respects your CPU’s right to be lazy 😴.

### 📺 [youtube2mediacms](https://github.com/tuxx/youtube2mediacms)  
> A Python script for syncing YouTube videos or channels to your self-hosted MediaCMS.  
> Because sometimes you just *need* to hoard your favorite videos offline 💾.

### 💬 [discord-irc-python](https://github.com/tuxx/discord-irc-python)  
> A Python bridge between Discord and IRC.  
> Bringing boomers and zoomers together, one message at a time 👴💬👦.

## 🧙‍♂️ Fun Facts

- 🧠 I speak fluent Python, Go, and sarcasm.  
- 🧰 My IDE is [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), because I like my text editors like I like my coffee — **lightweight, customizable, and occasionally crashes when I sneeze** ☕💻  
- 🐧 Because it's the law: I Run Arch BTW.

## ✨ Support My Sanity

⭐ Star one of my projects. It doesn’t pay the bills, but it makes me feel warm inside. Or send memes. Memes are good too.

If you do feel inclined to pull your digital wallet 💵 and buy me a coffee ☕ or a lamborghini 🏎️
